Directions










I sacrifice a lot into this game before it works fine. 
Starting from the numbers of days of No rest to the numbers of nights of No sleep. 

But am also Happy it finally works out ☺ ☺ 
Dont forget to comment..... cause no one is perfect and am subjected to corrections or upgrade. 

Thank you all.
